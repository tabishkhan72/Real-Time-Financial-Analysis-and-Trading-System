Introduction
In today’s fast-paced financial markets, real-time analysis is essential for timely and informed decisions. This project develops a Real-Time Financial Analysis & Trading System to process simulated financial data in real-time, generate actionable trading signals, and provide intuitive data visualizations.

It emphasizes distributed computing, microservices architecture, and stream processing, offering students and professionals a platform to simulate trading strategies and learn market dynamics.

Objective
The project aims to:

Build a scalable system for real-time financial data processing.
Calculate and visualize trading indicators (e.g., Moving Average, RSI).
Provide actionable insights through real-time notifications and an intuitive dashboard.
System Architecture
The architecture is guided by:

Microservices Design: Independent components for data ingestion, processing, and visualization.
Stream Processing: Real-time data handling using frameworks like Kafka.
Event-Driven Architecture: Enables responsiveness and scalability.
WebSocket Integration: Delivers real-time updates to the user interface.
Key Components
Data Generator: Simulates financial data with stock symbols, prices, volumes, and metadata like order book and sentiment.
Ingestion Service: Receives and validates data for processing.
Stream Processor: Analyzes data to compute trading indicators (e.g., MA, EMA, RSI).
Trading Signal Service: Generates buy/sell signals.
Notification Service: Sends alerts via email/SMS.
Visualization Service: Displays interactive charts and analytics on a user dashboard.
Load Balancer: Ensures system reliability under heavy traffic.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Install Apache Kafka, Python 3, Node.js, and Java (with Maven or Gradle).
Steps
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ebi2kh/Real-Time-Financial-Analysis-Trading-System.git  
cd Real-Time-Financial-Analysis-Trading-System
Install Dependencies:
Python: pip install Flask kafka-python
Node.js: npm install kafka-node
Java: Add Kafka dependency to your Maven/Gradle file.
Run Services:
Start Kafka and Zookeeper.
Run generate.py (data generator).
Run services (ingestion.py, trading_signal.js) using respective commands.
Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8080.
Mandatory Indicators
Moving Average (MA): Smooths short-term price fluctuations.
Exponential Moving Average (EMA): More responsive to recent price changes.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): Identifies overbought/oversold conditions.
Future Enhancements
ML Integration: Predict trends with machine learning.
NLP for Sentiment Analysis: Gauge market sentiment from news and social media.
Advanced Visualization: Interactive dashboards and 3D charts.
Risk Management Tools: Automate stop-loss and position sizing.
